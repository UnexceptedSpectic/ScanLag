# ScanLag

## About
A series of MATLAB scripts that can generate growth curves and doubling times from bacterial growth images across different strains in order to estimate fitness. A fork of the [ScanLag](https://github.com/oferfrid/NQBMatlab/tree/V16) project that includes additional MATLAB scripts for data exploration, statistical analysis, and plotting. More information can be found in the [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4215631/) of this method. 

## Usage
1. Follow the official manual found [here](https://github.com/UnexceptedSpectic/ScanLag/blob/master/usage_manual.pdf) for processing images in order to determine increase in colony surface area over time.

2. Use [this](https://github.com/UnexceptedSpectic/ScanLag/blob/master/sample_procedure.pdf) sample analysis procedure as a guide to assess the statistical significance in any differences across bacterial doubling times.
